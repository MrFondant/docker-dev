# A LAMP Local Development Environment on Docker

__An everyday local development environment for PHP Developers.__ At [Pivotal Agency](https://pivotal.agency), we've done a _buuunnnch_ of R&D to find the best local dev tools for our team. This is the result of our hard work. This tool has been put to its paces everyday by our team, we hope it can also help yours.

## Intro üëã

This is a set of Docker images to spin up a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) for developing locally. It's perfect for local development because you can very simply add new sites to specified directory and they're magically accessible as a subdomain of your chosen hostname (eg. eg. `~/Sites/info` maps to `http://info.localhost/`).

It includes all the required dependencies for everyday PHP development with common tools like Laravel, Wordpress and Magento (1 & 2).

Specifically, it has the following tech available:

* PHP 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 and 8.0
* MariaDB 10.2
* Redis 6.x
* Memcached 1.x
* Composer (latest)
* Mailhog (latest)
* Node.js (13.x) & NPM (latest) (PHP74 container only)
* Yarn (latest) (PHP74 container only)
* PHPCS (with Wordpress code standards added) (PHP74 container only)
* Wordpress CLI (PHP74 container only)
* HTTPS (SSL for localhost (not enabled - see FAQs)
* [Blackfire](https://blackfire.io/) (latest) (not enabled - see FAQs)

We have some clever domain mapping available to allow you to run code for various platforms. Sites are accessible from the following URLs (by default it's `http://<website>.localhost`, however `APACHE_HOSTNAME` can modified in `.env` to point to a different hostname):

* __http://classic-php.php56.{APACHE_HOSTNAME}__ (eg. http://classic-php.php56.localhost)
    * Will map to `~/Sites/classic-php` and use PHP 5.6
* __http://laravel.php70.pub.{APACHE_HOSTNAME}__
    * Will map to `~/Sites/laravel/public` and use PHP 7.0
* __http://php-project.php80.{APACHE_HOSTNAME}__
    * Will map to `~/Sites/php-project` and use PHP 8.0
* __http://another-project.{APACHE_HOSTNAME}__
    * Will map to `~/Sites/another-project` and use the default version of PHP (currently 7.4)

## Prerequisites ‚ö†Ô∏è

* Your machine must be running MacOS, Windows 10 _Pro_ or Linux
* Your CPU must support virtualisation (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)
* You must have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.25.0+) and Docker installed & running

## Installation üöÄ

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/pvtl/docker-dev && cd docker-dev

# Create & update relevant config (eg. point sites to your sites directory, set user/group ID's)
cp .env.example .env

# Start the environment and go get a ‚òïÔ∏è (it'll take a while to install e'ry-thing)
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Updating üîÑ

Open a terminal window, browse to this project's folder and run:

```bash
git pull                                           # 1. Pull from Git
docker-compose down --remove-orphans               # 2. Erase previous containers
docker-compose pull                                # 3. Get latest docker images
docker-compose build --pull --no-cache --parallel  # 4. Rebuild Dockerfiles from scratch (inc. pull parent images)
docker-compose up -d                               # 5. Start the new env
docker system prune --volumes                      # 6. Erase any unused containers, images, volumes etc. to free disk space.
```

*This will install the latest versions of all tools (eg. PHP, Redis, Node.js etc.)*

## Common Commands üî•

The Docker Engine must be running and commands must be run within this repo's root.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `docker-compose start` | Start all containers |
| `docker-compose stop`  | Stop all containers (keeps any config changes you've made to the containers) |
| `docker-compose up -d --build --no-cache` | Recreate all containers from scratch |
| `docker-compose down`  | Tear down all containers (MySQL data and Project files are kept) |
| `docker-compose exec php74-fpm bash`  | Open a bash terminal in the PHP 7.4 container |
| `docker-compose logs php74-fpm` | View all logs for PHP-FPM 7.4 |
| `docker-compose ps` | Show which containers are running |
